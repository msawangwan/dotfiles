dotfile backups
===============

this repository hosts back-up copies
of my dotfiles.

they're tedious to configure so having
a central location to store them is
convenient -- and hopefully, these will
help others who are seeking help in configuring
their own.

*feel free to use these configs yourself*

**current dotfiles**
- screen (apt-get install  screen)
- vim (includes plugin settings, managed by 'vim-plug')
- bash alias commands
