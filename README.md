dotfile backups
===============

github is an obvious choice when considering where
to store small, yet invaluable files. in this repository
you'll find a (growing) collection of many of the
dotfiles i'm currently using on my ubuntu server.

*feel free to use and edit to your liking.*

**current dotfiles**
-screen (apt-get screen)
-vim (includes some plugins)
