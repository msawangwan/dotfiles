dotfile backups
===============

this repository hosts a small but growing
collection of the dotfiles i'm currently 
using on my ubuntu server. they're tedious
to configure so having a central location
to store back-up copies is a good idea --
and who knows, maybe someone will find some
useful information for themselves.

*feel free to use these configs yourself*

**current dotfiles**
- screen (apt-get install  screen)
- vim (includes plugin settings, managed by 'vim-plug')
- bash alias commands
